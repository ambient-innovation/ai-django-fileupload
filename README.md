# Overview:
This package provides an easy way to implement the [jQuery Fileuploader](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload), in your Django project.

The uploaded files are stored through the Attachment model. Attachments could be linked to any model.

Additionally, a list of attachments is rendered along with the uploader button. These attachments have a convenient delete feature.  


# Installation:
- Add a requirement to your requirements.txt: 
    
    `ai-django-fileupload`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    `fileupload.apps.FileuploadConfig`

- Add module's urls to your url file:

    `url(r'^upload/', include('fileupload.urls')),`
    
- Add static files. They are not included in this package, though a convenient [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-django-fileupload) is provided.  
    
    `npm install ai-django-fileupload`
   
- Run migrations

# Settings

## Default thumbnail image
The uploader comes with a default thumbnail image, in case it couldn't be generated. 

You can set your own one, adding its location to the settings file: 

    UPLOADER_DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL = '/static/img/default-thumbnail.png'
    
Otherwise it'd be fetched from "static/node_modules/ai-django-fileupload/img/default-thumbnail.png". You may find useful to copy this image wherever your static content is stored. 

## Login required
If your uploader needs the user be authenticated, you can enable this restriction adding this to the settings file:
    
    UPLOADER_LOGIN_REQUIRED = True
    
# Usage:
- Include the upload_file template tag in your template:

    `{% load upload_file %}`
    
- Call it with the object that the uploaded files will be attached to:

    `{% upload_file obj=object %}`
   
   Make sure to put the template tag outside any other form tags you have since it will render a new form.
   
- For a minimal setup, please load the following files. Scripts order is important.
